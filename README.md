### Fungibility & NFT

#### Fungibility
- The ability of a good or asset to be interchanged with other individual goods or assets of the same type
- It implies equal value between the assets
- Simplifies the exchange and trade processes
- To put it into perspective, the fungibility of money refers to the fact that all money is the same. It doesn't matter whether you have one $100 bill or one hundred $1 bills.  You can use both of them to purchase the same product

#### NFT
- NFTs are unique cryptographic tokens that exist on a blockchain and cannot be replicated
- NFTs can be used to represent real-world items like artwork, real-estate, tangible items like collectibles
- "Tokenizing" these real-world tangible assets allows them to be bought, sold, and traded more efficiently while reducing the probability of fraud
